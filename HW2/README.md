Class Diagram: When designing this class diagram I began with the customer class and implemented the attributes as well as the operations according to the customer.  I then went into cartDetails and worked my way down from PaymentInfo splitting that class further into Address and CreditCard.  Lastly, I implemented the eBookstore class where the customer shops and the attributes for each book.  To complete this design I used UMLetino so I was limited to the design aspects of the free online UML tool.

Use Case Diagram: When designing the use case diagram I began with the actors which were the customer and the admin.  Then I listed the three main use cases for the customers and the use cases that go into more detail of each action that the customer can take.  For the admin I imagined the major use cases for the backend of the bookstore.  To complete this design I used UMLetino so I was limited to the design aspects of the free online UML tool.

Sequence Diagram for adding a book to the shopping cart:  When designing this sequence diagram I dove deeper into the use case of managing a shopping cart.  The customer is able to get a book and add, delete, or update their cart.  Once the cart is complete the user would checkout and logout of their account.  To complete this design I used UMLetino so I was limited to the design aspects of the free online UML tool.
